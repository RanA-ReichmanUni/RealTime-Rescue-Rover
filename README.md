# RescueRover (C++ Autonomous Rover Logic)

üõ†Ô∏è **Stage:** Early prototype ‚Äì class structure & planning phase

A simulation of autonomous rover logic written in modern C++.
The project is part of my exploration into embedded systems and autonomous movement strategies.

## Features

- `MovementManager`: Handles movement steps and interacts with the obstacle avoidance logic
- `RoverController`: High-level control and return-to-home mechanism (planned)
- `SimpleObstacleAvoidance`: Basic implementation of the `ObstacleAvoidance` interface
- Future modules planned: `MotorDriver`, GPS scanning, and signal-seeking logic

## Status
This is a work in progress ‚Äì more modules and logic will be added as development continues.
